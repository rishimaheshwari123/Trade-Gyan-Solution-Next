        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          An equity basket consists of multiple stocks grouped together based on a specific theme, industry, or investment strategy. 
          Investors use equity baskets to gain exposure to a segment of the market while reducing risks linked to individual stock fluctuations. 
          Hedge funds and institutional investors leverage equity baskets to enhance portfolio returns and balance market volatility.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          An Initial Public Offering (IPO) marks the transition of a private company into a publicly traded entity by listing its shares on the stock exchange. 
          IPOs present lucrative early-stage growth opportunities for investors willing to embrace market speculation and potential price fluctuations.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Stock options grant investors the right—but not the obligation—to buy or sell a stock at a predetermined price within a specific timeframe. 
          These instruments are widely used for hedging, generating income, and speculating on stock price movements, offering strategic flexibility for managing market risks.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Stock futures are standardized contracts that require traders to buy or sell a stock at a fixed future date and price. 
          These derivatives serve as a tool for hedging against price volatility and provide opportunities for leveraged trading based on anticipated market trends.
